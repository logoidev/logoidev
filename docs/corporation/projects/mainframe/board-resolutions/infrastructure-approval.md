WHEREAS the Corporation recognizes the strategic importance of owning and operating dedicated server infrastructure to support its mission of integrating advanced technology with theological and educational services;

AND WHEREAS the Corporation anticipates the need for local AI inference capabilities, offline Kubernetes orchestration, scalable compute resources, and robust dev-ops infrastructure in service of its operational resilience and long-term goals, including but not limited to the **Logoi Mesh¬©‚Ñ¢**, internal development, research, and secure client hosting;

AND WHEREAS the cost of operating comparable infrastructure on major cloud providers (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) would exceed **$40,000‚Äì60,000 CAD per year**, making in-house deployment a significantly more cost-effective and strategically sovereign alternative;
