		In the <a href="/blog/vision" class="underline">previous post</a> I've touched on the topic of directionlessness,
		confusion and lack of inspiration. I like to think of myself as an optimistic person, but even I
		at times feel hopeless with everything that's going on in the world. I share a belief that it is
		caused by the lack of a unifying positive goal and a great story of how to get there.
	</p>

	<p>
		One of the few things that recently gave me some hope is the establishment of <a
			href="https://www.arcforum.com/"
			class="underline"
			>ARC
		</a>
		- <i>The Alliance for Responsible Citizenship</i> and their first conference. The videos of the
		conference are
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@arc_forum/videos" class="underline"
			>freely available on YouTube</a
		>
		and I would suggest you watch at least
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84kKxtZI0l0" class="underline">
			this talk by Dr. Peterson
		</a>
		and my absolute favorite of the bunch -
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1MICwdQtfU" class="underline"
			>Konstantin Kisin’s speech</a
		>.
	</p>

	<p>
		ARC also publishes <a
			href="https://www.arc-research.org/research-papers"
			class="italic underline">research papers</a
		> and is generally a breath of fresh air among the apocalyptic fearmongers on social and mainstream
		media.
	</p>

	<p>
		Developing the habit of consistent writing is quite difficult for me, but I did answer <a
			href="https://www.arcforum.com/survey"
			class="underline bold">ARC's questions</a
		>
		and they were kind enough to send them to my email. Since the writing was done, I decided it is a
		good idea to publish my answers to these
		<a href="https://www.arcforum.com/survey" class="underline">6 important questions</a> (with minor
		editing).
	</p>

	<p>
		I would suggest that you answer them before you read my take, or you can do so after and
		hopefully correct, expand, or argue with my thoughts.

	<section class="flex flex-col">
		<b>Question 1: Vision and Story</b>
		<i class="my-2">Can we find a unifying story that will guide us as we make our way forward?</i>
		<p>
			Yes, I am sure of that. There are very few foundational stories we have, those stories that
			bind reality and order. Reality and social order are built on beliefs in stories. Story of the
			constitution, human rights, and stories on how we ought to behave in the world, shake hands,
			and clean our teeth. Of course religious stories are at the core, but we have many more -
			folklore, fairy tales, works of Homer, Shakespeare. All of these stories are about us and we
			know so little of them. How can we then hope for the same type of art and inspiration if we do
			not even reach out to these stories. And out of all, I've come to believe that the story of
			Jesus is objectively essential for the Western Civilization, and can most definitely say He is
			the atlas holding the world on his cross. Our duty is to help people hear about this story,
			reflect on it, recognize themselves in it and see how most everything around us stems from it.
			Only then we can live to experience the wonders that this <i>living</i> story brings and maybe
			play a good part in it.
		</p>

	<section class="flex flex-col">
		<b>Question 2: Responsible Citizenship</b>
		<i class="my-2">
			How do we facilitate the development of a responsible and educated citizenry?
		</i>
		<p>
			Our institutions of cooperative play and learning need to be better, they need to involve more
			hands-on things, smaller in-person classrooms, mentorships and apprenticeships. Of course it
			is quite difficult logistically and not very scalable, but you could and <i>should</i> diversify
			into online media. Make streaming/recording available for free or at least reasonably priced and
			accessible, on all possible video platforms to minimize the threat of censorship. We need to teach
			that choices AND inaction both have consequences and show the full spectrum of these consequences.
			We need to show that there are things worth sacrificing the immediate pleasures.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section class="flex flex-col">
		<b>Question 3: Family and Social Fabric</b>
		<i class="my-2">
			What is the proper role for the family, the community, and the nation in creating the
			conditions for prosperity?
		</i>
		<p>
			Like layers of the tree, it must come from the good and aligned individual and slowly spread
			to people in the closest proximity to "infect" as many people with the unified story of our
			collective lives. Family is the most close and intimate part and I am convinced that having
			your family in order is far more important than the "outside". Only then you can slowly invite
			more people into your lives in hopes of them becoming friends and later family.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section class="flex flex-col">
		<b>Question 4: Free Enterprise and Good Governance</b>
		<i class="my-2">
			How do we govern our corporate, social, and political organizations so that we promote free
			exchange and abundance while protecting ourselves against the ever-present danger of cronyism
			and corruption?
		</i>
		<p>
			The market of ideas needs to be as free and as allowing as the financial markets. I don't
			think we are yet capable of inventing a wealth distribution system better than capitalism. It
			needs to be guarded from monopolies and corporate lobbying, and must encourage enterprise, and
			scientific endeavors. The issue of monetary corruption and theft can be solved by employing
			cryptographically proven and open ledgers for public purchases made by the government,
			especially for large sums of money. Taxation can be automated and rethought in the process of
			adopting digital currency in government and large business institutions. Crypto-backed cash
			must stay at all cost and sufficient exchange mechanisms must be in place, but the fiat
			moneyprinting needs to be controlled.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section class="flex flex-col">
		<b>Question 5: Energy and Resources</b>
		<i class="my-2">
			How do we provide the energy and other resources upon which all economies depend in a manner
			that is inexpensive, reliable, safe, and efficient, including in the developing world?
		</i>
		<p>
			Nuclear power is the cleanest and safest resource out there. We must invest in the development
			of cheap electricity - even tho the nuclear waste is much easier to contain, the disposal
			issue needs to be solved by designating a special globally approved waste sites with quotas
			and reliable disposal funds. We must also keep relying on traditional mineral energy sources
			like coal, oil and gas, but try to limit it to production facilities or to utilize in remote
			places for mining of the crypto coin that I suggested in the previous question - virtually
			allowing to transmit the value of the consumed resources over the internet. This will allow
			development in the more remote places as well like the north (which is also very helpful for
			the cooling of the mining equipment). Northern countries like Canada, Russia and Denmark, will
			benefit greatly, but even other countries have plenty of access to cold, as well as
			international territories in Antarctica. Energy bound in icebergs and frozen lakes could be
			partially accessed. We should rely on natural gas for consumer use, heating or as a backup in
			case of spikes or volatility of the renewable power grid. All-electric 0-carbon renewable
			paradise is impractical, foolish and frankly impossible.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section class="flex flex-col">
		<b>Question 6: Environmental Stewardship</b>
		<i class="my-2">
			How should we take the responsibility of environmental stewardship seriously?
		</i>
		<p>
			Environments are reflections of society, when people are poor and insecure they do not think
			about how ecologically friendly is the plastic straw in their drinks. Only lifting people out
			of poverty can yield substantive results as humans have an undying tendency to improve their
			immediate environments and habitats. Education is the next or more often adjacent step. When
			people get used to the comfort inside our rooms, houses, and neighborhoods, only then will
			they start to expand their spheres of influence and order, self-govern and self-police other
			members of communities who do not respect the new rules of co-habitation. Enforcing these
			norms and rules top down is not going to work, it needs to be nurtured from within.
