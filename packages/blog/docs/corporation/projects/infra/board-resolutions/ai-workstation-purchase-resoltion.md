Pursuant to the bylaws of the Corporation, the Director is authorized to issue this resolution and to act with full authority under its Articles of Incorporation and applicable law.

**WHEREAS** the Corporation has identified a strategic need for a silent, powerful, and physically secure AI workstation capable of local large language model (LLM) inference, multi-agent orchestration, and creative AI generation;

**AND WHEREAS** the Corporation intends to operate this workstation offline or within trusted peer-to-peer networks as part of the **Logoi Mesh¬©‚Ñ¢**, and integrate it into secure developer and inference pipelines supporting client and internal systems;

**AND WHEREAS** the cost of comparable AI compute via commercial cloud platforms exceeds **$30,000 CAD/year**, the proposed workstation offers a materially more sovereign, private, and cost-effective alternative;

### BE IT RESOLVED THAT:

1. The Corporation hereby authorizes the acquisition and configuration of a high-performance small form factor AI workstation, internally designated as **Logoi Overkill Node 01¬©‚Ñ¢**;

2. The authorized capital expenditure shall not exceed **$5,250 CAD**, inclusive of all hardware, taxes, shipping, premium cabling, and integration costs;

3. The workstation shall include the following components:

   - **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 9 9800X3D (Zen 5, 12c/24t, 3D V-Cache)  
   - **GPU:** NVIDIA RTX 4090 Founders Edition, 24GB GDDR6X (12VHPWR)  
   - **Motherboard:** ASUS ROG STRIX B850-I Gaming WiFi (mini-ITX, PCIe 5.0, DDR5, WiFi 7)  
   - **RAM:** Corsair Vengeance DDR5 128GB (2√ó64GB) 5600MHz CL40  
   - **Storage:** Corsair MP700 PRO 4TB Gen5 NVMe SSD  
   - **Cooling:** Asetek 240mm AIO, SFF-optimized with liquid CPU block and radiator  
   - **Case:** Custom Asetek-compatible mini-ITX enclosure supporting GPU + 240mm AIO  
   - **Fans:** 2√ó Noctua NF-A12x25 PWM (Chromax Black)  
   - **Power Supply:** Corsair SF1000 (1000W, SFX, ATX 3.0 compliant)  
   - **Cabling:** CableMod Pro ModFlex full sleeved kit (Corsair SFX)  
   - **Adapter:** CableMod 90¬∞ 12VHPWR GPU adapter for clearance  
   - **Operating System:** Windows 11 Pro with dual-boot Ubuntu 22.04 LTS for AI/k8s workloads

4. The system shall support and be pre-configured for:

   - High-speed local inference for open-weight LLMs (Mistral, LLaMA 2, Gemma)  
   - GPU-accelerated image generation (Stable Diffusion XL, LoRA training)  
   - Audio transcription and synthesis (Whisper, Bark, TTS)  
   - Multi-agent orchestration (LM Studio, CrewAI, vLLM)  
   - Local-first Kubernetes orchestration via K3s or MicroK8s  
   - Airgapped inference and client-facing deployments  
   - Dev workflows including container builds, GPU inference APIs, and private model serving

5. The Corporation shall record this infrastructure as a long-term capital asset and depreciate it in accordance with CRA Class 50 depreciation schedules;

6. The Director shall oversee secure installation, BIOS and firmware updates, fan curve tuning, undervolting for thermal optimization, and cable routing in accordance with operational best practices;

7. The system shall be physically secured in a protected developer environment and integrated into Logoi‚Äôs broader mesh network infrastructure when required;

8. The infrastructure shall serve as a baseline node for future **Logoi Mesh¬©‚Ñ¢** deployments, and shall be expandable through:  
   - Additional NVMe storage  
   - Secondary inference accelerators via PCIe bifurcation or USB4  
   - Remote inference handoff via Cloudflare tunnels or custom mesh overlays

9. The Director is authorized to procure all components from reputable Canadian vendors and apply up to ¬±15% variance for shipping, taxes, or stock-based substitutions, as long as functionality and theological mission are preserved;

10. Upon installation, the Director shall document thermal benchmarks, inference throughput (tokens/sec), and case airflow integrity and store results alongside the Corporation‚Äôs infrastructure ledger.
