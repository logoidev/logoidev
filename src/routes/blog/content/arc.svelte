		In the <a href="#blog/vision" class="underline">previous post</a> I've touched on the topic of directionless,
		confusion and lack of inspiration. I like to think of myself as an optimistic person, but even I
		at times feel hopeless with everything that's going on in the world. I share a belief that it is
		caused by the lack of a unifying positive goal and a great story of how to get there.
	</p>

	<p>
		One of the few things that recently gave me some hope is the establishment of <a
			href="https://www.arcforum.com/"
			class="underline"
			>ARC
		</a>
		- <i>The Alliance for Responsible Citizenship</i> and their first conference. The videos of the
		conference are
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@arc_forum/videos" class="underline"
			>freely available on YouTube</a
		>
		and I would suggest you watch at least
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84kKxtZI0l0" class="underline">
			this talk by Dr. Peterson
		</a>
		and my absolute favorite of the bunch -
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1MICwdQtfU" class="underline"
			>Konstantin Kisin’s speech</a
		>.
	</p>

	<p>
		ARC also publishes <a
			href="https://www.arc-research.org/research-papers"
			class="italic underline">research papers</a
		> and is generally a breath of fresh air among the apocalyptic fearmongers on social and mainstream
		media.
	</p>

	<p>
		Developing the habit of consistent writing is quite difficult for me, but I did answer <a
			href="https://www.arcforum.com/survey"
			class="underline bold">ARC's questions</a
		> and they were kind enough to send them to my email. Since the writing was done, I decided it is
		a good idea to publish my answers to these 6 important questions.
	</p>

	<p>
		There are <a href="https://www.arcforum.com/survey" class="underline">only 6 questions</a>, and
		I would suggest you answer them before you read my take, or you can do so after and hopefully
		correct, expand, or argue with my thoughts.

	<section class="flex flex-col">
		<b>Question 1: Vision and Story</b>
		<i class="my-2">Can we find a unifying story that will guide us as we make our way forward?</i>
		<p>
			Yes, I am sure of that. There are very few foundational stories we have, those stories that
			bind reality and order. Reality and social order is built on beliefs in stories. Story of the
			constitution, human rights, stories on how we ought to behave in the world. Of course
			religious stories are at the core, but we have many more - folklore, fairy tales, works of
			Homer, Shakespeare. All of these stories are about us and we know so little. I'm ashamed to
			admit that I haven't read them either. How can we then hope for the same type of art and
			inspiration if we do not even reach out for them. Out of all the story of Jesus is essential,
			Jesus is the atlas holding the world on his cross and our duty is to help people hear about
			our story and live to experience the wonders it brings now and can bring in the future! Truth
			can only be built on truth.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section class="flex flex-col">
		<b>Question 2: Responsible Citizenship</b>
		<i class="my-2">
			How do we facilitate the development of a responsible and educated citizenry?
		</i>
		<p>
			Our institutions of cooperative play and learning need to be better, they need to involve more
			hands-on things, smaller in-person classrooms (mentorships perfectly) and online
			streaming/recording for free on all possible video platforms to minimize the threat of
			censorship. We need to teach that choices AND inaction both have consequences and show the
			full spectrum of these consequences.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section class="flex flex-col">
		<b>Question 3: Family and Social Fabric</b>
		<i class="my-2">
			What is the proper role for the family, the community, and the nation in creating the
			conditions for prosperity?
		</i>
		<p>
			Like layers of the tree, it must come from the good and aligned individual and slowly spread
			to people in the closest proximity to "infect" as many people with the unified story of our
			collective lives.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section class="flex flex-col">
		<b>Question 4: Free Enterprise and Good Governance</b>
		<i class="my-2">
			How do we govern our corporate, social, and political organizations so that we promote free
			exchange and abundance while protecting ourselves against the ever-present danger of cronyism
			and corruption?
		</i>
		<p>
			The market of ideas needs to be as free and as allowing as the financial markets. I don't
			think we are yet capable of inventing a wealth distribution system better than capitalism. It
			needs to be cleaned from monopolies and corporate lobbying but must encourage enterprise and
			scientific endeavors. The issue of monetary corruption and theft can be solved by employing
			cryptographically proven and open ledgers for public purchases made by the government,
			especially for large sums of money. Taxation can be automated and rethought in the process of
			adopting digital currency in government and large business institutions.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section class="flex flex-col">
		<b>Question 5: Energy and Resources</b>
		<i class="my-2">
			How do we provide the energy and other resources upon which all economies depend in a manner
			that is inexpensive, reliable, safe, and efficient, including in the developing world?
		</i>
		<p>
			Nuclear power is the cleanest and safest resource out there. We must invest in the development
			of cheap electricity - the nuclear waste issue needs to be solved by designating a special
			globally approved waste site with quotas and reliable disposal funds. We must also keep
			relying on traditional mineral energy sources like coal and oil, but for production facilities
			or to utilize in remote places for mining of the crypto coin that I suggested in the previous
			question - virtually allowing to transmit the value of the consumed sources over the internet.
			This will allow development in the more remote places as well like the north (which is also
			very helpful for cooling the mining equipment). Countries like Canada and Russia will benefit
			greatly, but other countries, have plenty of access to cold, as well as international
			territories in Antarctica. Energy bound in icebergs and frozen lakes could be accessed.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section class="flex flex-col">
		<b>Question 6: Environmental Stewardship</b>
		<i class="my-2">
			How should we take the responsibility of environmental stewardship seriously?
		</i>
		<p>
			Environments are reflections of society, when people are poor and insecure they do not think
			about how ecologically friendly is the plastic straw in their drinks. Only lifting people out
			of poverty can yield these results as humans have an undying tendency to improve their
			immediate environments. When they get used to comfort inside their rooms, houses, and
			neighborhoods will they start to expand their spheres of influence and order and self-govern
			and self-police other members of communities who do not respect the new rules.
