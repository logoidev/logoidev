	<p class="text-center mb-2">Welcome to our blog!</p>
	<p>
		This is an introductory post where I wanted to shed some light on this yet very small collective
		we've established - our background, motivations, and goals.
	</p>

	<p>
		My name is <i class="underline">Vlad</i> and I am a software engineer - it’s quite a technical and demanding profession,
		and I’d like to think I’m reasonably good at it, and, most importantly, I’m very lucky to actually
		enjoy it. I am convinced that we need more engineers to be motivated to perfect their craft and be
		ethically good and moral in the use of their skills.
	</p>

	<p>
		Together with my brother <i class="underline">Andrew</i> and our <i>new</i> friend <i class="underline">Adam</i> we're looking to explore new ways
		to learn, educate, and use technology to inspire, wow, and uplift people beyond utilitarian convenience
		of technology.
	</p>

	<p>
		I was very blessed to have met people in my life who encouraged education and opened many doors
		for me, my family being at the absolute core of it. So a natural question arose - how do I give
		back? To them, to my son, and to the future members of my family, our friends, and larger
		networks of people and communities around them.
	</p>

	<p>
		As an engineer in this modern technological world, I've been granted quite a bit of power and
		ability, yet I felt empty and directionless. Building digital products and startups is extremely
		fun and fulfilling, and yes - it does pay well, but what is next? Will the fruits of my labor
		be valuable not just for me but after I'm gone? I'd love to think there is a path to answer
		these questions positively. Time and time again I remember the words spoken to my favorite super-hero
		by his dying <i>father</i>... Yet we seem to be running away from responsibility, or what could
		be worse, taking on responsibility that is not ours and often failing at that as well.
	</p>

	<p>
		The world right now is in a very dangerous and unstable state. Confusion, panic, anxiety,
		overwhelming amounts of information, aimlessness, radicalization, normophobia, and inability to distinguish
		what is true is at the core — and technology seems to make it all even worse. Yet I am convinced
		it doesn't necessarily have to. <i>"Making the world a better place"</i> is somewhat of a joke in the
		tech community, but I hope there are enough of us there who take it seriously.
	</p>

	<p>
		Are we all building a digital cage for ourselves? And if the algorithms continue to grow in
		power over our lives in the future, is that future actually good and hopeful? Do the machines
		know what is good or bad, are they even capable, and more importantly - do the people who build
		them know? Can we use progress to prevent poverty, hunger and <b>war</b>, rather than cause
		them? I've come to believe that while science and technology are undoubtedly extremely powerful,
		there are things beyond the rational world that are true, valuable, and absolutely necessary for
		us to live good and prosperous lives, individually and collectively.
	</p>

	<p>
		What about art, literature, the stories we tell, and ethics we share? Rationalism is quite
		unfulfilling if you take it seriously, and I’d say we have taken it way too seriously, to our
		own detriment. How can you not learn anything from the horrors of twisted rationalism of Marxist
		ideology? Or those of fascism. I’m convinced that the scientific and rational truth is not the
		the only type of truth the order is built upon, and quite arguably the unknowable and unprovable is
		far more important than science.
	</p>

	<p>
		My favorite work of art is the Sistine Chapel — I dream of one day seeing it with my own eyes and
		show it to my son. But how was it made? Is it built on pure science and engineering? Definitely
		that is a big part — it had been beautifully designed by some brilliant architects of the
		Renaissance age, and built by the hands of the people whose names are unknown to most. But what
		of the works of art decorating the walls? They are known worldwide and made by the most
		brilliant artists whom we have never surpassed. It's much more than layers of paint on the walls
		— at least we all act like it is, and travel great distances for a chance to see it.
	</p>

	<p>
		What motivated the patrons and donors to sponsor such projects? What motivated Michelangelo to
		study and perfect his mastery to craft such beauty? Why do we even perceive it as beautiful? I
		can only explain it with divine inspiration and faith. <i
			>"I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free."</i
		>. Have you ever seen an angel let alone freed one? Of course, I will never be Michelangelo, but
		I can only try to follow in his steps and possibly inspire a new one to be born, educated and
		encouraged to pursue their craft to the extent it is possible.
	</p>

	<p>
		It hurts to realize that we have not seen anything close to such beauty produced since the
		Renaissance. Why have we lost access to such inspiration while gaining so much technological
		power? Why have we lost the charity of spirit to finance such things and devotion to something
		so beyond us and on a scale our ancestors did? Could it be they were actually much smarter and
		wiser than we are? Of course, these are rhetorical questions — but I think most people would
		agree we did lose <i>something</i>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Growing up in a Soviet-built boxed utilitarian beehive the only beauty I saw in architecture
		were churches, as even the monuments were reflective of the soviet doctrines. Orthodox churches
		and Christian art, are among the only places that were preserved and still hold beauty as
		something valuable, at least in Eastern Europe. After coming to the West, I glimpsed this too,
		but it is so rare. Apart from an occasional beautiful family house, I see copy-pasted spread out
		suburbs, like a huge shopping mall that needs you to be put in metal boxes on wheels to get
		anywhere. The West, apart from the legacy left by our inspired European ancestors, lacks such
		communal places in comparison. Very few churches are the exception, at least here in Canada,
		like The Cathedral Church of St. James in Toronto with beautiful stained glass icons.
	</p>

	<p>
		Now our art and beauty are challenged, disrespected, and even intentionally destroyed like a
		tragedy of Notre-Dame fire in 2019. So how do we protect it, preserve it, and spread it? Do we
		have what it takes to build anew?
	</p>

	<p>
		I love art and have faith that we will learn to prioritize and combine liberal arts education
		and unite it with science and technology.
	</p>

	<p>
		I wrote my master's paper on the topic of ethical computing, which has come to be even more
		relevant to the recent advances in AI and its consumer adoption. More power is given to these
		systems mindlessly, which could be a race to the grave. How can we teach the machine what is
		good and moral if we do not know ourselves? Can we continue to combine the wisdom and
		inspiration of our fathers with the blessings of technology, science, and progress, or are they
		just incompatible?
	</p>
	<p>
		One thing programming teaches you is the importance of abstraction and reliance on solid
		foundations to build anything that works. We are so accustomed to the miracle that things always
		work - electricity, water, heat, accessible food, sewage, the internet, banks, open borders, <i
			>freedom...</i
		>
		Fleeing <b>war</b> in 2022 my family has experienced how truly fragile it all is. If something
		breaks deep down the stack it takes out everything on top, like a house of cards, and I feel
		like we are messing with the source code of our civilization's operating system we know
		<i>nothing</i> about. I don't think we even know the <i>language</i>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another programming joke is a comment used by developers to indicate to not even attempt to try
		any <i>"improvements"</i>.
	</p>
	<pre class="text-sm">// Here be DRAGONS </pre>

	<p>
		It is comical how true it is. Usually, it indicates that the code was initially poorly written,
		or has grown in complexity over time so that is now hard to understand, but it <i>works</i> and
		it's <b class="underline">important</b> - so mess with it at your own peril. Same with culture - we must know what
		is true, solid, and working, and protect it at all costs.
	</p>

	<p>
		This is my vision for Logoi. The name comes from the plural of λόγος — the truthful breath of
		God that binds things together. The smaller constituting pieces of Logos are <span
			class="text-2xl font-serif">logoi</span
		> and I think it reflects the goal to bring together many different and independently good things
		into something coherent and better. I hope to combine my continued education in liberal arts with
		my skills and interests in the most advanced and exciting technologies I can think of, which for
		me are design, software engineering, web development, UI, spatial computing, web3, and AI.
	</p>

	<p>
		There are great many examples of technological achievement and success. Like the printing press,
		electromagnetism, or the splitting of an atom. Even today I see technology used to solve real
		issues and make people's lives better daily. Personally, I regard Google Maps as a technological
		wonder, so are YouTube, Google Search, and of course Apple. I am inspired by their creators just
		as much as I am inspired by Leonardo and his peers. I can not mention all the giants on whose
		shoulders we collectively stand as there are too many, but physicists, mathematicians and
		engineers have discovered many wonders of the world, including the Promethean power of the
		nuclear energy. But
		<i>techne</i> can also be used to bring great sorrow — due to malevolence, corruption, inaction or
		even by mistake and untruthful craft. As a Ukrainian, Chernobyl is a story engraved in my soul, showing
		the true dangers of science, technology, and engineering gone horribly wrong. So let's try to be more
		careful and truthful, both in our work and with each other.
	</p>

	<p>
		We wish to continue in the steps of great people of the past and align technology with the
		concepts of ethics, morality, and beauty, so please pray that we can do that to the best of our
		abilities.
	</p>

	<p>
		We really hope you are interested in helping us learn and find ways to apply and unite these
		interests, and we welcome any feedback, advice, ideas, criticism, and all new acquaintances along
		the way.
